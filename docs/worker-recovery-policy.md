# Autonomous blocker recovery contract

This document specifies the intended scheduler behavior; it does not claim the runtime already implements it.

## Recovery lifecycle

1. Detect stalled work by CI terminal failure, unchanged failure fingerprint on repeated attempts, or expired worker heartbeat/lease. Distinguish ordinary queued CI from a failure.
2. Deduplicate incidents by project, root task, failing workflow and normalized failure fingerprint. Assign one owner and a recovery deadline. Do not steal an active lease.
3. Classify safe automatic action: retry transient failures with exponential backoff and a bounded budget; for deterministic code/configuration failures route a single root-fix task to an authorized owner. Never weaken CI or security checks.
4. Park only the dependent task while routing unrelated ready tasks to workers with healthy capacity. Avoid creating child PRs against blocked parent branches.
5. Reconcile the original task on terminal CI state: green means review/merge eligibility under existing gates, red means root-fix, not blind retries. Record resulting-main verification after merge.
6. Escalate to a human only for required permission, an irreversible/high-risk decision, or exhaustion of safe recovery routes. Never auto-grant sudo or bypass required review.

## Minimal incident payload

- **Problem:** project and one-sentence cause, with evidence link.
- **Action:** current automatic recovery step, owner and deadline.
- **Status:** recovering / waiting / needs your input / resolved.

The dashboard and audit show the same current incident state, highest impact first; Wear OS alerts only for actionable human escalations. Historic resolved incidents must not appear as active blockers. Suppress duplicate alerts and report recovery outcomes.

## Capacity guardrails

Throttle admission of heavy jobs on sustained memory pressure, swap saturation, or runner unavailability; do not terminate running jobs solely on a single load sample. Resume conservatively when resources recover. Preserve self-hosted runner boundaries and least privilege.


## Executable policy explainer (advisory only)

scripts/zsentinel_recovery_policy.py turns one bounded, operator-supplied incident receipt into a deterministic HOLD or READY_FOR_HUMAN_REVIEW explanation. It is deliberately separate from the recovery router: the router diagnoses incidents and suggests independent work; this command explains whether a specific proposed action has the minimum policy evidence. It performs no network I/O and never executes the proposed action.

    python3 scripts/zsentinel_recovery_policy.py --input incident.json --format markdown

Use --input - to read JSON from standard input, --format json for a machine-readable receipt, and --max-age-minutes N to set an explicit freshness window (1–1440; default 60). The input must be UTF-8 JSON, at most 256 KiB, with no duplicate keys, unknown properties, symlinks, or non-standard numeric constants. Source URLs must use HTTPS on github.com or the approved Notion hosts.

Supported proposed actions:

- retry_ci: terminal red exact-head CI, classified transient failure, remaining numeric retry budget, elapsed backoff, clear claims, healthy capacity and owner authorization.
- route_root_fix: deterministic failure, confirmed root cause, named owner, no active/unknown claim and owner authorization.
- assign_independent_work: explicit ready task, positively established disjoint scope, no active/unknown claim, healthy capacity and owner authorization.
- merge_pr: verified exact head, green required CI, independent approval, satisfied branch protection, zero unresolved review threads, verified not-yet-merged state and owner authorization.
- deploy: exact-head CI/review/protection, verified merge on main, healthy post-merge state, release approval, runtime-owner authorization and healthy capacity.
- restart_runner: verified unavailability, no running jobs, confirmed cause, runtime-owner authorization and explicit human approval.

The evidence is supplied by the operator and is not independently re-fetched or verified. Missing, stale, contradictory or adverse evidence yields HOLD. A clear result means only READY_FOR_HUMAN_REVIEW; it is not a grant of authority, merge approval or deployment permission. GitHub's actual exact-head checks, branch protection, review state and the responsible runtime/release owner remain authoritative.

Every result explicitly records advisory_only=true, evidence_independently_verified=false, actions_executed=false, and false claim/retry/merge/deploy/restart side-effect flags. The tool cannot acquire a claim, retry a workflow, merge a PR, deploy or restart a runner.
